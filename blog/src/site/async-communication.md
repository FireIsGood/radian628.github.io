# How to Get Answers in Asynchronous Communication
You've probably had the annoying feeling before of trying to resolve a technical problem with someone over an asynchronous medium&mdash; say, a chat room or email&mdash; yet constantly encountering setbacks related to miscommunication, lack of responses, or other such things. While there are some problems that are arguably unavoidable in such media, there are also a lot of mistakes that can easily be avoided. 

Here are what I believe to be the most useful tips, based on my years of experience both asking and answering questions online. For context, most of my experience asking and answering questions is in the realm of programming.

## Take up as little of the answerer's time as possible
People who answer questions are lazy. They're often volunteers who do this in the passing time between tasks they have to do. They want to spend as little time as possible answering questions, so if they see a question that looks like it will take a long amount of time to answer, they're probably going to ignore it.

Many of the tips below are little more than specific instances of this one. When in doubt, pretend you're trying to answer your own question. How can you give yourself the least amount of work possible?

## Open immediately with your question
If you're asking a question, the first message you send should be the question you want answered. One common mistake is to start with a greeting, and only *then* begin one's question. This might seem polite in a normal setting, but think about it from the standpoint of the person answering:

Imagine you're sent a message: "hey, I need help with this." You wait patiently for the next two minutes as the user types up their actual question and eventually posts it. This two minutes is time you could have spent doing something you actually wanted to do. Instead, you spent it waiting for someone to post a question. You'd be better off answering someone who begins with a question immediately. And, as such, that's what answerers tend to do.

### Don't ask to ask
A more insidious form of this is the "asking to ask" question. The classic example is "Are there any Java experts around?" Ostensibly, the person asking this question wants help with something they're doing in the Java programming language. However, they're going to be unlikely to get an answer. Why? There are a few main reasons.

The main one is that they aren't opening with their question in the first place. A potential answerer would presumably have to confirm that they are in fact a "Java expert" and then&mdash; somewhat ironically&mdash; ask *the asker* for their actual question. Only after doing this will they be able to answer their actual question. It adds unnecessary effort for both parties&mdash; The asker has to ask this additional question, and the answerer has to poke and prod for the actual question.

Another reason they won't get an answer is that potential answerers are being excluded, possibly for no reason. What if the Java question involves concepts universal to any programming language? What if someone doesn't consider themselves a "Java expert," but has more than enough knowledge to answer it? It's best to cast as wide a net as possible.

A third reason is that this message is a red flag to answerers&mdash; it indicates that the asker may be trying to rope them into a synchronous conversation where they have to communicate in realtime.

## Avoid obligate synchronous communication 
I've been throwing around the terms "synchronous" and "asynchronous." Let's pin down what they mean. 

In this specific context, "synchronous" communication refers to communication that happens in realtime, where messages tend to be sent in sequence in timespans of seconds. Face-to-face communication and voice/video calling are both examples of this. 

Conversely, "asynchronous" communcation refers to communication that happens with a potential time delay between messages, which could potentially be minutes, hours, days, or in rare cases weeks or more. Chat rooms, email, forums, and voicemails are examples of this.

In general, when asking questions in an asynchronous medium, you will scare off potential answerers if you try to get them to switch from an asynchronous medium (e.g. a chat room) to a synchronous one (e.g. a voice call). The former is something they can engage with on their own terms at any time during the natural gaps in their activities. The latter is something that takes up most or all of their attention and requires that they potentially reorganize a large block in their schedule. 

In other words, asynchronous communication likely takes up far less useful time than synchronous communication, making potential answerers more inclined to use asynchronous communation. That being said, this isn't entirely universal&mdash; if you can't learn without a voice call and need someone to join you, there are often still going to be people more than willing to do so.

## Minimize back-and-forth
When asking and answering questions, every message sent represents a bit of time spent. These little bits of time can easily add up if the conversation has a lot of back-and-forth, especially when one party must wait for the other to respond. In this way, asynchronous media can become synchronous media, suffering many of the same problems described above. Chat rooms are especially vulnerable. Of course, again, this isn't necessarily a problem&mdash; it depends on the person. 

Even when asynchronous media stays asynchronous, needless back-and-forth can still be a problem, stretching conversations on for days and weeks, all while the problem remains unresolved and the conversation nags in the back of the asker's mind. 

### Prefer too much detail over too little detail
How does one minimize back-and-forth? One way is to maximize detail. Give as much detail as possible when asking for help, even if its relevance seems only tangential. Paradoxically, *more detailed* responses are probably going to get faster answers than *less detailed* ones, to a certain degree. This is because the more detail an answerer has to work with, the more likely they'll be able to formulate a complete solution without asking you for more detail. Conversely, with less detail, an answerer is more likely to have to ask you to elaborate. The less time they have to spend waiting for you to respond for requests for detail, the faster your question can be answered.

## Explain the problem, not just your proposed solution
Imagine someone came to you and asked you "How do I get better at cycling?" Let's just say you know about cycling, so you give them an exercise routine, explain bicycle maintenance to them, et cetera. While you're doing this, you get curious and ask: "So why do you want to learn cycling anyway?"

"Well, to generate electricity to power my house, of course!"

This is an example of explaining one's solution rather than one's problem. This mistake is also known as the "XY" problem&mdash; the problem where you ask how to do *X*, when what you really needed is *Y*. In this case, the asker wanted to know how to cycle, when what they *really* needed was a more feasible way of getting power to their house&mdash; solar panels, hooking it up to the grid, etc. To avoid this, always at least explain the root problem you are trying to solve. You can include your solution as well, but do not be surprised if the answerer knows a better one.

## Show your progress
As a frequent answerer, I know I've kind of made us out to be lazy and disinterested. However, many of us *like* answering questions, and it can be stressful not knowing whether something was successfully resolved. If at all possible, let us know! We'd love to hear! This even helps answer the question&mdash; if you proactively show us your progress, we know what we still need to explain and, conversely, what we *don't* need to explain.
