            <h1>Nebula Fractals Breakdown</h1>
            <p>This project contains what I like to call "nebula fractals." Many kinds of fractals may seem somewhat complicated or intricate, but are actually generated by a very simple underlying algorithm. Nebula fractals are no different.</p>
            <p>To create a Nebula Fractal, start with a <a href="https://radian628.github.io/small-projects/tree-fractal-maker/index.html#donotreflect">tree fractal</a>. Play around with this generator to see how they work. Essentially, each branch has two branches branching off of it, each rotated a specific angle relative to the original branch, and scaled by a specific scale factor relative to the original branch.</p>
            <p>To turn these tree fractals into nebula fractals, one has to do the following:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Make the tree fractals 3D.</li>
                <li>Have the tree fractals branch off into three branches rather than two.</li>
                <li>Draw a point at the ends of the terminating branches, but don't actually draw any of the branches.</li>
            </ol>
